1. Project description and goals

My project is Steel defect detection. Originally defect detection is very important research field 
in manufacturing-based company. Because if there is a defect production, their company loses 
trust from customers. So, in the process of production, defect things can cause very big issue 
to them. Therefore, in the view of ai engineer, I want to make a defect detection model about 
steel. And my final goal is to make the best performance or state of the art performance in this 
field
